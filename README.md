## Instructions

The folder '3Dircadb1' contains the data for our project which is a public resource that can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ircad.fr/research/3d-ircadb-01/).

The 'data_preprocessing' folder contains the necessary tools for CT preprocessing, sinograms generation and reconstrution via the FDK algorithm from any specific angular range.

The folder 'train_models' contains a series of models including the baseline model proposed by [Syben et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13342), and models based on this basline with additional networks in projection and reconstruction domain. The reconstructed CT results are stored in each model foler as well as the numerical evaluation results. The best training session is also saved for each model.

An overview of files tree in this project is shown below:
